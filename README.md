- **Combined Streamlit App:** The macro indicators from this repo will be integrated with DeFi/on-chain data into a single interactive Streamlit application.  
- **Goal:** Provide a holistic view of how macroeconomic conditions (liquidity, rates, USD strength, volatility) interact with crypto-native flows (stablecoins, exchanges, L2 activity) to shape market behavior.
